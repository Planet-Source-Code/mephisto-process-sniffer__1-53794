Process Sniffer 

Green Box - files in database that you can check
Red Box - Files are not in database, you can only search for them

if the program determines that you have a virus/adware/spyware installed, it will display
the process and it will then add the comment - ATTENTION i suggest you do the following >

go to Start > Run > and type in msconfig
hit enter
go to the very last tab (StartUp) and find the process that is virus. Uncheck it. This will 
prevent it from starting again. 


I hope you enjoy my application.
